----------- INSTALLING THE KINECT SOURCES -----------
-----------------------------------------------------

Open a terminal pointing to this directory.

Enter:
sudo chmod +x install.sh

Then, enter:
sudo ./install.sh

-------------- Additional Information ---------------

The installation includes:

* The general OpenNI framework;

* the SensorKinect sources to communicate with a
  kinect device; and

* the NITE middleware interpreting the Kinect data
  and providing high-level user interfaces.

Libraries and Include files will be added globally.
For samples, source code and documentation, see 
the NITE folder.
To browse the HTML documentation, open 
NITE-Bin-Dev-Linux-x64-v1.5.2.21/Documentation/html/
index.html.

If the installation has been successful, standalone
.cpp files using the OpenNI framework should be
compilable by executing "g++ example.cpp -lOpenNI -lXnVNite_1_5_2 -I/usr/include/ni -I/usr/include/nite".
If you face any problems while installing, maybe
I can help, so talk to me.
