----------------------------------------------------
---------- INSTALLING THE WIIMOTE SOURCES ----------
----------------------------------------------------

Open a terminal pointing to this directory.

Enter:
sudo chmod +x install.sh

Then, enter:
sudo ./install.sh

-------------- Additional Information --------------

The installation includes everything needed to get a 
wiimote connected to a PC (except for the required 
Bluetooth hardware, obviously). 
Libraries and Include files will be added globally.
For samples, source code and documentation, see the 
folder "WiiC" which is being created inside this 
directory during the installation.
To browse the HTML documentation, open 
WiiC/doc/html/index.html.

If the installation has been successful, standalone
.cpp files using the WiiCpp framework should be
compilable by executing 
"g++ example.cpp -lwiic -lwiicpp".

If you face any problems while installing, maybe
I can help, so talk to me.
